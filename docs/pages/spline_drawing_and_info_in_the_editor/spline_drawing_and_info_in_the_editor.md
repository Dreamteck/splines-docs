# Spline Drawing and Info in The Editor
By default, splines are drawn only when selected in the editor but that can be changed from the bottom panel of the Spline Computer’s inspector – Info & Debug.

Expanding the Info & Debug panel, a couple options are presented:

- Color in Scene – The color of the spline used to draw it in the editor
- Always Draw Spline – Should the spline always be drawn regardless of whether it is selected?
- Draw Thickness – Toggling it draws the spline’s thickness, based on the control points’ sizes

If Draw Thickness is selected, each spline sample is drawn as a perpendicular line:
